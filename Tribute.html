        <h2>About Elon Musk</h2>
        <p>
            Elon Musk is a visionary entrepreneur and the CEO of multiple high-impact companies, including SpaceX, Tesla, Inc., and Neuralink. Known for his ambition to revolutionize space travel, electric vehicles, and even the human brain, Musk has been at the
            forefront of technological innovation. Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Musk moved to North America to pursue higher education and subsequently began his entrepreneurial journey with Zip2 and X.com (which later became PayPal).
        </p>
        <p>
            His vision has often transcended conventional boundaries, as seen in his founding of SpaceX with the goal of making humanity a multiplanetary species. Tesla, under his leadership, has become one of the most influential companies in pushing electric vehicles
            to the mainstream. Beyond these ventures, Musk's companies are involved in renewable energy, brain-machine interfaces, and high-speed transportation. His relentless drive and willingness to take risks have made him a highly influential figure
            in modern technology and innovation.
